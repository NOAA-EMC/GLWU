List of all code/scripts modified with this release

The wave model codebase 'wave_code.v5.16.0' has been integrated into the 'wave_glwu.v1.1.0' codebase:
modulefiles/build_wavewatch3.modules -> modulefiles/
wave_code.v5.16.0/st4nc_nl3/sorc/make.codes.sh integrated into sorc/make.all.sh 
wave_code.v5.16.0/st4nc_nl3/sorc/*.fd -> sorc/

Large fix files were moved out of 'wave_glwu.v1.1.0' and stored on WCOSS2 (>50 MB Github limit). 
These are now installed by running sorc/get_externals.sh (called by make.all.sh build script):
fix/mesh.glwu
fix/grint_weights.grlc_2p5km
fix/grint_weights.grlr
fix/grint_weights.grlr_500m

New directory with dev testing scripts (please ignore):
dev/

New directory with production .ecf scripts:
ecf/

Files modified:
versions/wave_glwu.ver replaced by versions/build.ver and versions/run.ver
modulefiles/build_glwu.module
modulefiles/build_wavewatch3.modules
sorc/make.all.sh
sorc/multiwavefcst.fd/makefile
sorc/multiwavefcst_sbs.fd/makefile

What changes were made to the above code/scripts to support the new architecture?
Full use was made of the 128 cores/node and the larger RAM, so that the node count was 
reduced significantly from 32 to 6 (forecast job). These changes are in the ecf files. 
Changes to makefiles were needed due to changes in library path environment variables on 
WCOSS2. Remaining changes were due to EE2 standards: (i) The use of build.ver and run.ver, 
(ii) Writing AWIPS products to wmo/ instead of pcom, (iii) Removing .ecf extension from 
ex-scripts. 

Were any other changes made that arenâ€™t directly related to the transition?
No

Are there any changes to incoming data needs or outgoing products? 
No

If output filenames are changing, list the current and new filename
N/A

*** Providing PBS and/or ecFlow submission scripts as part of release tag is preferred; 
if they are provided then resource information is not needed in the release notes.
