TITLE:
 wave_glwu.v1.0.1: Bugfixing ice concentrations with intermediate values for unstructured
                   grid compatibility

SUMMARY:
- Create conservative ice intake to fix large wave heights in breakup ice regions
- Changes the ice concentration thresholds in the wave_glwu.inp file
- Changes the ice concentrations threshold in the inpaint_nic_glwu.f90 pre-processing code

CHANGE REQUEST CLASS:
Burgfix

STRUCTURE AND RESOURCE DESCRIPTION

CHANGES TO SCRIPTS AND CODES:
1) Input file
  - wave_glwu.inp in the fix directory has been updated with explicit ice concentration
    bounds.

2) Executable
  - inpaint_nic_glwu.f90 has been updated to enforce explicit ice concentration bounds
    to incoming NIC ice concentrations data.

DISSEMINATION INFO

BUGFIXES
As per above

BENEFIT OF CHANGE:
Attenuates wave growth in ice-covered areas, its boundaries and in regions of ice breakup.

USER IMPACT STATEMENT:
Attenuates unrealistic high waves in areas of breakup ice.

TECHNICAL IMPACT STATEMENT:
No impacts to current system profile/metrics.

TESTING
Dev testing completed. 

RISKS:
N/A
