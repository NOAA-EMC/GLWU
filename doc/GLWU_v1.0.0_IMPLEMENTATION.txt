A) TITLE:
 wave_glwu.v1.0.0: Upgrade of the wave_glw system to unstructured spatial grids

B) SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES
wave_code.v5.16.0
- This system requires installation of the WAVEWATCH III code package v5.16.0
  which has not yet been installed in the Cray X40
- Checkout wave_code.v5.16.0 from svnemc server
  
- Follow installation instructions in that system directory

C) CODES IN WAVE_GLWU.v1.0.0 SORC DIRECTORY
 convert_ndfd_glwu  
 inpaint_nic_glwu  
 wave_glwice

D) IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
 1) Check out wave_glwu.v1.0.0 from the svnemc server
 2) Build exec codes using make.all.sh (invokes build_glwu.module)
 3) A few binary files will be loaded to the svn server. If they need to be 
    re-generated, do as follows: start the model from a cold run to generate 
    the following binary fix files (in fix directory)
   - for interpolation
     weights grint_weights.grlc_2p5km grint_weights.grlr grint_weights.grlr_500m
   - Generating the weights files for the first time can take *VERY* long, up to 
     a few hours.
   - model definition files
   - As said above these files will initially be made available in svnemc.
 4) Cold start run  will also initialize the first restart file for subsequent runs
   - glwu does not need long spinup time due to small basin size, cold start OK.
 5) wave_glwu start time
- This version uses bottom-of-the hour NDFD files, expected to arrive at /dcom
  1/2 hour earlier than current NDFD files. 
- New system start should be reset to ~1/2 hour earlier than current runs, my
  suggestion is set to 45' past each hour. 
- To set proper start time, check publication time of glwu.grlc_2p5km_sr.tCYCz.grib2
  and glwu.grlc_2p5km.tCYCz.grib2 to /com. If this is before 15' past the hour, the
  set time to start wave_glwu is good.
 6) Trigger for PGEN
- The PGEN step should be triggest by SENDECF whenever the tar file glwu.tCYCz.cbull_tar 
  becomes available,
- The POST step creates large grib2 files at the end that delay delivery of AWIPS files in 
  case a trigger is not the to the above tar file.
 7) Runtime modules for operational steps
  - All steps: "prod_envir prod_util PrgEnv-intel iobuf"
  - PREP and POST steps: above modules and also "cfp-intel-sandybridge"
 8) PGEN step need review. J-job and ex-script have been tested in dev but need perl
    scripts to be tweaked as follows:
    - formbul.pl and formbul_config in util_shared/1.0.5 need to have internal paths
    in formbul.pl to formbul_config need to be hardwired or properly added in formbul.pl
    in formbul_config, paths to PCOM, deckpath and jlog_file need to be properly set
