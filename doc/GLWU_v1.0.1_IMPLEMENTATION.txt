A) TITLE:
 wave_glwu.v1.0.1: Bugfixing ice concentrations with intermediate values for unstructured
                   grid compatibility

B) SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES
wave_code.v5.16.0
- As currently installed, no changes required. 
  
C) CODES CHANGED IN WAVE_GLWU.v1.0.1 SORC DIRECTORY
 inpaint_nic_glwu.f90 needs to be updated with the  new code and recompiled. 

D) INPUT FILE CHANGES
 the fix file wave_glwu.inp has been cheanged.

D) IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
 1) Check out wave_glwu.v1.0.1 from the git server
    >> git clone gerrit:EMC_wave_glwu

 2) Build exec codes n the sorce directory using make.all.sh (invokes build_glwu.module)
 3) Make sure that no  wave_glwu*.moddef.* files are present in the fix directory,
    these should be generated when the system is run for the first time.
 4) All restart files from the current operational runs should work seamlessly.
 5) Copy the file weights grint_weights.grlc_2p5km grint_weights.grlr grint_weights.grlr_500m
    from the current operational fix directory (wave_glwu.v1.0.0/fix):
   - **** ATTENTION **** 
     Generating the weights files for the first time can take *VERY* long, up to 
     a few hours.
 6) If restart files are not available, cold start run  will also initialize the first restart file for subsequent runs
   - glwu does not need long spinup time due to small basin size, cold start OK.
