TITLE:
 wave_glwu.v1.0.2: Eliminating risk of writing restart file to prod directory; fine-tuning ice concentrations to avoid unrealistic wave heights
                   near areas of recently-melted ice.

SUMMARY:
- COMRSTout is set to a subdirectory of COMOUTwave, no longer COMINwave, eliminating
  risk of writing over /com/wave/prod when running tests
- Changes the ice concentration thresholds in the wave_glwu.inp file: fine tunes wave behavior in
  newly-melted ice regions.eliminating instability noticed in unstructured grids

CHANGE REQUEST CLASS:
Bugfix

STRUCTURE AND RESOURCE DESCRIPTION

CHANGES TO SCRIPTS AND CODES:
1) exwave_glwu_forecast.sh
   - Has been updated to reflect COMRSTout now writing to subdirectory in COMOUTwave

2) J-JOBS have been updated to eliminate references to COMINOUT

3) Input file
  - wave_glwu.inp in the fix directory has been updated with new ice concentration
    bounds.
