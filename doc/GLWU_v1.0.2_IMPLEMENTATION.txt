A) TITLE:
 wave_glwu.v1.0.2: Eliminating risk of writing restart file to prod directory; fine-tuning ice concentrations to avoid unrealistic wave heights
                   near areas of recently-melted ice.  
                   

B) SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES
wave_code.v5.16.0
- As currently installed, no changes required. 
  
C) INPUT FILE CHANGES
 the fix file wave_glwu.inp has been changed.

D) IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
 1) Check out wave_glwu.v1.0.2 from the git server
    >> git clone gerrit:EMC_wave_glwu

 2) ***VERY IMPORTANT*** DELETE any wave_glwu*.moddef.* files in the fix directory,
    these should be generated when the system is run for the first time.
 3) All restart files from the current operational runs should work seamlessly.
 4) Copy the file weights grint_weights.grlc_2p5km grint_weights.grlr grint_weights.grlr_500m
    from the current operational fix directory (wave_glwu.v1.0.0/fix):
   - **** ATTENTION **** 
     Generating the weights files for the first time can take *VERY* long, up to 
     a few hours.
