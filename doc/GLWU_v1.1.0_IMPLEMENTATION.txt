A) TITLE:
 wave_glwu.v1.1.0: Port codebase from WCOSS1 to WCOSS2 
                   
B) SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES
- The wave model code 'wave_code.v5.16.0' has now been integrated into the 'wave_glwu' 
  codebase. See GLWU_v1.1.0_RELNOTES.txt for details. It is now built as part of wave_glwu, 
  and is thus no longer an external dependency.
  
C) INPUT FILE CHANGES
 None

D) IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
 1) Clone wave_glwu from Github, and checkout the release tag:
    >> git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/wave_glwu.git
    >> git checkout IT-wave_glwu.v1.1.0-20211003

 2) >> cd wave_glwu/sorc
 3) >> ./make.all.sh 
 4) ***VERY IMPORTANT*** DELETE any wave_glwu*.moddef.* files in the fix directory,
    these should be generated when the system is run for the first time.
 5) All restart files from the current operational runs should work seamlessly.

E) TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
  1) The WCOSS2 installation has been tested using canned input data from WCOSS1. These 
     are available from:
     /lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/GLWU/dcom/prod/20211003/wgrbbul
  2) Set DCOM to the above canned data directory.
  3) Copy the 01z restart file from the canned WCOSS1 output to the local COMOUT. The former  
     is available at:
     /lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/GLWU/COM_wcoss1_prod/glwu.20211003/glwu.glwu.t01z.restart
  4) Set %CYC% to 01 to run the long cycle (149 hours).
  5) Compare output to the canned WCOSS1 01z output available at:
     /lfs/h2/emc/couple/noscrub/Andre.VanderWesthuysen/GLWU/COM_wcoss1_prod/glwu.20211003
  6) Using the restart created by the 01z cycle, set %CYC% to 02 to run the short cycle (48 hours).
  7) Compare output to the canned WCOSS1 02z output above.
